# Pessimism and Overommitment

The online experiment is available at https://transcriptiontask-f46b6.web.app/.

The application used for the experiments was built using React. The project source code is found in the folder "transcription-app SRC 22112021". To further develop or change the application, knowledge of React is necessary (see reactjs.org).

To test the application as it was when the experiments were performed, a folder called "build" is provided for convenience. In this folder, the application is launched by opening the file "index.html" in a browser.
